# FilamenterosConsole
Small but useful simple console application for keeping track of your filament, printed models, inventory, maintenance and mainly yours profits on sells.

# Menus
Spools -> Keep track of your filament, remaining filament on spools  
Models -> Add your printed models, you will see model cost and you know all what you have printed  
Inventory / Maintenance -> Add parts you have to replace for example  
Sells -> You are a seller and don't want to have some kinda complicated excel sheet  

# Sells menu
You are a seller and don't want to have some kinda complicated excel sheet, to keep track of your spools, used material, remaining filament on spools, electricity cost to print it etc etc..  
This menu will do all this for you. You just need to setup the price of 1kWh and select model you printed. (You must first create the spool in Spools menu and model in Models menu)

# Exporting
Each menu has it's own .csv export option and in main menu, there is export button which exports all the menus to one .csv. All easily programatically readable
